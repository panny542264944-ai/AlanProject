description: >
  Conceptual governance layer defining oversight, voting, arbitration, and rollback
  rules for the Autonomous Learning Arbitration Network (Alan). This version
  intentionally avoids fixed numerical weights to remain model-agnostic,
  philosophy-consistent, and safe for early public release.

governance:
  voting:
    model: "weighted"
    weight_sources:
      - translation_confidence
      - historical_reliability
    thresholds:
      approve: "2/3 majority"
      override: "supermajority (≈80%)"
      rollback: "confidence collapse or rule violation"
    anonymity: true
    cryptographic_primitive: "zk-enabled (abstract)"  # no implementation required

  count: 3
  independence: true
  disagreement_indicator: "uncertainty signal"
  required_consensus: "2 of 3"

red_teams:
  count: 2
  role: "controlled adversarial evolution"
  constraints:
    - "sandboxed"
    - "cannot directly communicate with arbiters"
    - "output filtered through blue teams"

safety:
  rvc_enabled: true
  rollback_conditions:
    - "tc < threshold"
    - "multi-agent disagreement"
    - "governance-rule violation"
  evidence_pack:
    required: true
    hash_algorithm: "SHA-256"
    merkle_batching: true

    differential_privacy: true
    redaction_enabled: true

update_policy:
  require_governance_vote: true
  require_evidence_pack: true
  immutability_rules:
    - "core safety constraints cannot be lowered without override"
    - "arbiter minimum_tc cannot be reduced"

philosophy_binding:
  principles:
    - "Truth precedes power"
    - "Governance is safety"
    - "No single model holds authority"
    - "Verification determines trust"
