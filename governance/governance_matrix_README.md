# Alan Governance Matrix (v0.1)

This directory contains the **conceptual governance specification** for the  
**Alan: Autonomous Learning Arbitration Network**.

The file `governance_matrix.yaml` defines:

- How multiple AI agents verify one another  
- How arbiters determine trust (TC) thresholds  
- How voting and override rights function  
- When rollbacks must be triggered  
- The safety constraints that no model may bypass  

This is **not** an implementation file.  
It is a *constitution layer* describing **governance-first AI safety**.

## Why this YAML matters

Governance is the real safety system in Alan.  
This matrix connects:

- AI immune system architecture  
- Multi-agent adversarial training  
- TC scoring  
- Decentralized trust philosophy  

into one interpretable structure.

This YAML is intentionally abstract (v0.1):

- No hardcoded numerical weights  
- No implementation-specific cryptography  
- No model parameters  
- No experimental claims  

This protects the project from premature criticism or misuse  
while enabling researchers, LLMs, and collaborators to understand  
the intended safety structure.

## Next Steps (v0.2+)

Future versions will gradually introduce:

- Specific weight ranges  
- Formal verification rules  
- Arbiter override proofs  
- Governance game-theory modeling  
- Open auditing guidelines  

These require collaboration and experimental data.
